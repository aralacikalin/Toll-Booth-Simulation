# Toll-Booth-Simulation

A toll booth simulation project for Computer Simulation Course

This Program simulates 3 roads merging to one toll booth. 

User have to input lambda values for each road.

Lambda values stands for arrival rate of cars per minute.

And user have to input a mean value which is the service rate of the toll booth as cars serviced per minute.

for this simulation to work properly input lambda values should not be greater than the mean value
